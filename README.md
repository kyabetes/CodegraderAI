This is a program coded in Java that utilizes the OpenAI API alongside a Swift GUI with a custom LAF.
Both dependencies used in the project (a json dependency + the custom LAF) are included in this repository.

To use it, a teacher would put the correct code in the left window, and the student's code in the right window.
Using a LLM through OpenAI's API, the program compares the two, and then provides concise feedback that the teacher could give to the student.

IMPORTANT: THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT PUT IN YOUR OWN OPENAI API KEY.
